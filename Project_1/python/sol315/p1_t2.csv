(guitar,acoustic),1,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best.. Industry Standard"

It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals.. Definitely Not For The Seasoned Piano Player"
(time,long),1,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4" stereo... It's high quality, and very solid, I definately expect this to last me a long time.. Versatility..."
(guitar,good),1,"I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar. this strings have good sound and hold a tune well. the best thing is the price is great.

(stand,mic),0,"This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect.

You can cover all six strings, move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo (though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down.).All in all, a great capo that is well made and will last forever.Kyser is an awesome small Christian company and I really like their products and supporting them with my purchases. :]. Great"
(quality,high),1,"When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer. For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.. I Got Great Pricing, But Still a Really Good Product"
(strings,good),1,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo, but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos,  important to take it off when not in use so the "rubber" does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another.. Good, effective capo"
(bit,little),0,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft. Good quality, great price"
(sound,good),1,"Hosa cable quality can be all over the place, some of their products are good (sound good, reliable, long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively, break prematurely, short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice, they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami), they sound good and so far they are working reliably, the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert, we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. These cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.We have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.I would buy more if I needed them.. So Far So Good"
(quality,sound),0,"I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money.. Excellent quality, exactly what I needed"
(pedal,great),1,"First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.  You HAVE to get this pedal!. You'll never buy another chorus pedal"
(amp,little),1,"It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.First of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and off.Next! I wish they'd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34;, &#34;overdrive&#34;, &#34;distortion&#34;, and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.Then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.None of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.. Nice little amp with a few annoyances"
(pedal,good),1,"I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the "perceived" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off.. Best tremolo pedal for the money"
(strings,new),1,"I restrung my Martin 0-16NY with these strings and found them to be excellent.  As a new guitarist,the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound.. Very Impressive product!"
(guitars,acoustic),1,"This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended.. works great for acoustics"
(guitar,new),1,"Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar. It seems to work well, no issues in the first couple of weeks.. Cable works as described"
(price,Good),1,"I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable.. Does the job. What more do you need?"
(im,sure),0,"Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys.... Add California to the name and I jump!"

(guitars,electric),1,"I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them. They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times. Great capos. You won't be disappointed.. Perfect capos"
(tuner,little),1,"Super nice locking tuners. Used these as a direct drop in replacement for my Paul Reed Smith SE245 and really helped with tuning and stability. The smaller tuner buttons looked a little strange at first, but once installed looks great and works great.. Get Your Axe In Tune"
(guitar,little),1,"I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.. Didn't fit my 1996 Fender Strat..."
(strings,acoustic),1,"I love these strings, and use them for all of my acoustic playing. Best of all, I can find them here for $3.49 per set, so I'm not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time. Easy to play, and they sound great.long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time.. Best Acoustic Strings"

(guitar,easy),1,"The title says it all.  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store.  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove.  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used.  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  And best of all... it works!. It's cheap, easy, sturdy, and works"
(time,first),0,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills, tough as nails, and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals, this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail, or get up close for some bass response, or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic, 25-ft cable, cable tie, carry pouch, and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra.. Great all-around vocal mic"
(price,low),1,"I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise, this is an excellent cable, with good build quality and a strong, thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables, and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm, guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over, try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!. Good quality, low price"
(guitar,nice),1,"I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up, dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my "gloating" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.  Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTIC.New rule for me, no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week!!!!!. After a proper set-up 5 stars  Damn nice guitar"

(end,low),1,"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a "Shure Model 545 Unidyne III."  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.. Best all around for over 30 years!"

(price,same),1,"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First, it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be "gentle" with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!. Light Weight Cable For Stereo Mics With Limitations"
